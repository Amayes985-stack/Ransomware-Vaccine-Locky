# Ransomware-Vaccine-Locky
This tool written in C++, demonstrates how to vaccinate against the Locky ransomware, preventing the ransomware from running and encrypting the infected machine.

These "vaccines" come from this Lexsi's post : [https://www.lexsi.com/securityhub/comment-creer-un-vaccin-contre-le-ransomware-locky/](https://www.lexsi.com/securityhub/comment-creer-un-vaccin-contre-le-ransomware-locky/)

### How to use it ? 

  - Download the executable from this page : ([https://github.com/cryptobioz/LockyVaccine/releases](https://github.com/cryptobioz/LockyVaccine/releases))
  - Run it by doube-clicking.

### Note 
**This is just a PoC, it's probably not 100 % efficient.**
